	DEMO PROGRAM #1, Self-organizing growth in light environment

	This model is designed to work with the L-system-based modeling program L-studio,
        which can be donwloaded from http://www.algorithmicbotany.org

	The following demonstration code uses a simple light environment class to grow a single tree,
	with internal controls via an extended Borchart & Honda style resource system.

	


#############
This version has extra set to generate a list of XYZ for use by fdim (R)
This version takes over from SelfOrg20101017XYZMTGV3
Includes a Leaf module and the code to make that work
#define PHYLLOANGLE 137.5 is now hardcoded as 137.5 as I can't think of reason to change it 23 June 2011
Version 4.1 decouples the supply of light from leaves and the demand for resources by the buds
Includes a MTG reader to build a plant first, replaces Seed

The new branches are glued back onto the node that started the branching, rather than the redigitisation of the starting node
